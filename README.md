Types of ANNs and Recurrent Neural Network

Use Case Description:
1. Sentiment Analysis on the Twitter dataset
   
Programming elements:
1. Basics of LSTM
2. Types of RNN
3. Use case: Sentiment Analysis on the Twitter data set

In class programming:
1. Save the model and use the saved model to predict on new text data (ex, “A lot of good things are
happening. We are respected again throughout the world, and that's a great thing.@realDonaldTrump”)
2. Apply GridSearchCV on the source code provided in the class
